# Plan for Updating GENIBI App Color Palette and Authentication Flow

## Information Gathered
- User wants a fresh, modern, health-centered color palette:
  - Primary Color: Teal / Turquoise (#009688)
  - Secondary Color: Light Green (#4CAF50)
  - Accent Color: Soft Blue (#2196F3)
  - Background: Light Mint / Off-White (#F5FAF9)
  - Text Color: Dark Gray (#333333)
- The palette should be reflected everywhere in the app UI.
- UI should be authentic and clear, not vague.

   - ✅ Replace existing color variables with the new palette.
   - ✅ Ensure background, text, buttons, links, and other UI elements use these colors.
2. ✅ Review and update login/signup flow in `health-app/auth.js` and related files:
   - ✅ Ensure login and signup screens appear before main app.
   - ✅ Confirm UI uses new colors.
3. ✅ Update logo colors in UI if applicable.
4. ✅ Test the app UI to verify color consistency and auth flow correctness.
5. ✅ Make any necessary adjustments based on testing.
